# About
In quantum physics, a wave function **collapses** when it transitions from a hypothetical **superposition** -- a phenomenon that allows a quantum system to exist in multiple states at once -- to a **singular** state. 

On the other hand, the **Wave Function Collapse Algorithm** is a computational technique used in artificial intelligence and procedural generation. The algorithm iterates through each cell in a definitive grid which all begin with the same possiblity of potential, distinct patterns called **tiles**. The initial possibility of unique tiles in a singular cell is equal to the total number of tiles. These possibilities are named the **entropy** of the cell and begin to decrease when the program accounts for tile neighbours and the preset constraints of each tile. This causes these patterns to **collapse** into a coherent and visually appealing result.

# Usage
#### To begin generating your own patterns...
1. Enter  `git clone https://github.com/Gurvirr/Wave-Function-Collapse.git` in the Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Locate the cloned repository by typing `Wave-Function-Collapse` in Windows Start
3. Run one of the three `.exe` files

##### OR

1. Head over to the repository [homepage](https://github.com/Gurvirr/Wave-Function-Collapse "homepage"): `https://github.com/Gurvirr/Wave-Function-Collapse` 
2. Click the green dropdown labelled `Code`
3. Click `Download ZIP`
4. Extract the zip folder onto your computer
5. Run one of the three `.exe` files


##### You can also run the `Python source file` named `WFC.py` if you have the `Pygame library` installed. Note that in order to switch between the 3 connectivity modules, you will have to update line 4:
